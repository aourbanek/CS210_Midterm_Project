# CS210_Midterm_Project
The first GitHub repository created by Alan Urbanek for CS 210.

## Content
This repository serves and will serve as a home for all code written by me for the CS 210 Midterm Project at Bradley University. So far, progress has been assigned in Milestones:
### Milestone 1
Set up a GitHub repository to host code and get familiar with the commit system. You're here on it!
### Milestone 2
Write code to load data (Schools & related info) from a .csv file and interact with it in simple ways: searching, deleting, displaying.
### Milestone 3
Extend the previous implementation, using a BST instead of a Linked List to load schools.
### Milestone 4
Extend Milestone 2 again, using a Hash Table instead of a BST.
### Milestone 5
Implement timing and larger datasets within all three implementations to compare their performance.
